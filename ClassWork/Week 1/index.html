    <h1>What is a Gamebook?</h1>
    <p>A gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the read to participate in story making <strong>choices</strong>. The <i>narrative branches</i> along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Production of new gamebooks in the west <sub>decreased</sub> dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away from <sup>print based media</sup></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are three types of gamebooks.<br> The first is the branching-plot novel, which require the reader to make choices
    but are otherwise like a regular novel. These Gamebooks are sometimes informally called choose your own
    adventure books or CYOA which is the name of the well known Choose Your Own Adventure series originally
    published by Bantam Books.<br> The second type is the Solitaire adventure (an example of this is the Tunnels and Trolls
    series of gamebooks), which combines the branching-plot novel with the rules of a role-playing game, allowing the
    game to be played without a Gamemaster but may require the purchase of separate manuals.<br> The third type is the
    Adventure gamebook (examples of these are the Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf series of gamebooks), which
    combines the branching-plot novel with a simple role-playing system unique to the book (or series).</p>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p> Several influences contributed to the development of the gamebook format during the twentieth century. The
    possibility of having stories branching out into several different paths seems to have been first suggested by Jorge
    Luis Borges in his short story An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain (1941). This story features an author
    whose novel is a three-part story containing two branch points, and with nine possible endings. Another story by
    Borges, titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths">"The Garden of Forking Paths"</a> (1941), also describes a book with a maze-like narrative reminiscent of
    modern gamebooks. These stories, however, did not carry out the idea of branching-path narrative to full execution.</p>
